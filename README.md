# SalesBarChartGenerator
Write a program that asks the user to enter today’s sales for five stores. The program should display a bar chart comparing each store’s sales. Create each bar in the bar chart by displaying a row of asterisks. Each asterisk should represent $100 of sales. Here is an example of the program’s output:

    Enter today's sales for store 1: 1000 [Enter]
    Enter today's sales for store 2: 1200 [Enter]
    Enter today's sales for store 3: 1800 [Enter]
    Enter today's sales for store 4: 800 [Enter]
    Enter today's sales for store 5: 1900 [Enter]
